# Power-DSP

Social, technological and political innovation combined in a coherent strategy is often more effective at offering solutions to environmental issues than more established, traditional policy mechanisms. In recent years, important environmental challenges have been addressed by more socially-conscious approaches. What is described as social innovation can provide a vital impetus to the successful implementation of environmental policy. There have been significant advances at a European level in issues such as energy, the reduction of CO2 and sustainable public transport. This has been achieved through increasing awareness of the problem, providing platforms through which policy is conducted effectively indicating the most appropriate means of addressing the issues in question and by supplying the instruments and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) necessary to guarantee political continuity and policy completion.

POWER is a user-driven H2020-CAPS2020 action and an EIP Water Action Group related project pioneering the DSP approach to share knowledge and experience on water scarcity, security, quality and water consumption-related issues in different EU local authorities, thus creating an important tool for EU water policy.

POWER will 

increase the transnational municipal network effect by facilitating unrestricted communication and community involvement and by creating collective intelligence on ways of addressing urban climate change mitigation and adaptation, targeting water related concerns; 
influence related policy planning and decisionsand expand related socially innovative behaviour. 
Develop a Digital Social Platform (DSP) that will enable residents, stakeholders, and authorities to communicate about water related issues and share best practices.
Demonstrator Cities and the Water Related Issues:
The POWER four water issues (water consumption reduction, water quality, extreme weather events, variables related to water conservation) will be addressed by developing a TRL 7 common DSP system prototype to be demonstrated in Milton Keynes, Sabadell, Leicester, and Jerusalem each city addressing one priority issue. Though each city will lead the approach for its specific priority challenge, the common pier DSP enables an integrated approach, which will enhance the potential for comparison and benchmark of all cities involved. Other cities will contribute their knowledge and experience to the four key issues.

The 4 municipalities involved as Key Demonstration Cities are already active in water related issues. Extensive data is therefore available on each of these cities; common data is used to calculate the City Blueprint as is data addressing specific local city issues. Progressively, City Blueprints for approximately 100 cities will be available (approximately 3 to 4 cities in each Member State), which will share their data challenges and best practices, with the aim to contribute to a European Urban Agenda 2050. Currently 38 cities have been assessed for their City Blueprint in 23 different countries, mainly in Europe. It is realistic to include another 70 to 80 cities before the end of the Project.

Based on the regional patterns that can already be distinguished from the City Blueprint activities, examples of local communities in some of the cities will be chosen that are taking action to address a specific water or climate change related issue in their city. A more in-depth study of the governance structures and the governance gaps will be carried out. Local initiatives to bridge these gaps can then be explored and used as examples for other cities in that region.

The Digital Social Platform:

The POWER Digital Social Platform aims at sharing progress, knowledge, opinions and best practices in an open public consultation mode and will serve as a support tool for driving sustainable behaviour and extending a raised collective awareness on the environment and the consequences of our actions. Cities will share their City Blueprints and their real time data via the DSP. This will be predominantly at the professional office level, with detailed input. Such information will be summarised and shared with the general public.

The POWER DSP will bring together EU leading multi-disciplinary scientists, industrials, policy makers and general public to think and act collectively, to engage in public dialogues, to communicate new ideas and solutions in a user-driven platform by using open source frameworks.

The POWER approach therefore combines the experience of the lead cities with an important number of follower Cities. These followers include the members of EIP Water Action Group City Blueprints, members of NetwercH2O, and the cities, which have concluded their CITY BLUEPRINTS. The results will be then be transferred to the following partners dealing with the same and other issues related to the POWER concept. These partners will be involved once the DSP is operating successfully.

POWER DSP will be a decision-support environment able to:

Quantify impacts over the long term.
Include the most relevant viewpoints.
Incorporate expert knowledge but engage non-technical decision-makers.
Reach defendable decisions through a repeatable, audible and transparent process.
be implemented andpopulated with best practices related to the four key issues;
bring together EU leading multi-disciplinary scientists, industrials, stakeholders,to think and act collectively, to engage in public dialogues, to communicate new ideas and solutions in a user-driven platform by using open source frameworks; 
provide real time data sharedin an innovative way and regularly updated to maintain people’s interest; 
use gamification to help people compare.
POWER platform will enable the integration of mobile applications that relate user behaviour and feedback with context dashboard of indicators according to physical location, allowing the DSP to drive users through a path of incremental commitments towards a pool of defined sustainability goals. It will be more than just dashboards and indicators. We will take data from the case study cities and promote benchmark patterns and optimal profiles for sustainable behaviours. 

Water Issues & Pilot Cities
Milton Keynes – Reduction of water consumption

Water scarcity is constraining new developments taking place in Milton Keynes. Action therefore needs to be taken to reduce overall consumption to allow further development.

Water scarcity has the potential to constrain new developments taking place in Milton Keynes. Action therefore needs to be taken to reduce overall consumption to allow further development. The POWER DSP model will address this by sharing and exchanging knowledge with citizens and schools. Milton Keynes is a leading UK City in terms of data and data provision. The MK Smart Initiative is an example of this and feedback from MK Smart will be shared with the POWER DSP.

The main goal for the City of Milton Keynes, in the POWER project, is to promote water conservation behaviour and achieve quantifiable water savings using social awareness incentives. The POWER DSP will allow citizens to monitor water usage online, enhancing social gamification mechanisms and increasing individual and collective awareness. By connecting city inhabitants through a network, they will be able to see good and bad practices of others and exchange advice on how to improve consumption.

 

Sabadell – Water quality
In the city of Sabadell water is supplied in two qualities: drinking water and water for non-drinking purposes. The goal is to provide consumer information to encourage better management of resources and a reduction in the consumption of drinking water to be replaced by non-potable water.

In the city of Sabadell water is supplied in two qualities: drinking water and water for non-drinking purposes. In all cases the water has a quality according to established legal requirements. CASSA is implementing an information system that enables real-time information about the quality and conditions of service throughout their distribution networks. This will allow users to take appropriate decisions, such as going to alternative points of supply in the case of irrigation tank trucks and street cleaning. The POWER DSP will provide consumer information to encourage better management of resources and a reduction in the consumption of drinking water to be replaced by non-potable water.

The main goal of the city of Sabadell is to promote improved water quality by the active involvement of citizens. The POWER DSP will allow citizens to monitor the water quality online enhancing social gamification mechanisms and increasing individual and collective awareness. By connecting city inhabitants through a network, they will be able to identify different levels of water quality and openly judge and voice their opinions concerning the resource.

 

Leicester – Leicester has a surface water flood risk
City of Leicester has developed GIS mapping and river level gauge data to try and identify potential flood risk. Leicester will then take further action to reduce the risk of surface water flooding, through public engagement activities via the DSP.

Leicester is in the top 10 cities in the UK at highest surface water flood risk. It has developed GIS mapping and integrated live river level gauge data to identify potential flood risk. Leicester is currently engaging with householders, businesses and communities about surface water flooding. However, given that surface water flooding is less well known and not directly associated with rivers and watercourses, some members of the public do not see it as a problem. The POWER DSP aims to increase awareness of flood from multiple sources and provide practical guidance that residents, businesses and communities can implement to reduce their flood risk. Leicester will then take further actions to reduce the risk of surface water flooding, through public engagement activities via the POWER DSP.

The main goal of the POWER project in Leicester is to promote awareness of extreme weather events and associated flooding by providing information and practical guidance in addition to real time river water levels and predictive warnings. Through the POWER DSP users will be able to assess their potential risk of flooding through online social gamification mechanisms, increasing individual and collective awareness. By connecting city inhabitants through a network, they will be able to observe different flood risks.

 

Jerusalem – Variables related to water conservation
Limited water supplies and high water tariffs are at the centre of Hagihon’s strategy to diminish water loss and to ensure the quality of potable water.

Limited water supplies and high water tariffs are at the centre of Hagihon‘s strategy to diminish water loss and to ensure the quality of potable water. Hagihon has accumulated substantial experience in the implementation of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) reducing technologies and operational methodologies – achieving NRW of about 6% in most of its network. The POWER DSP will enable Hagihon to share NRW reduction and water quality data with other utilities and consumers and assist in the ongoing process of maintaining consumer awareness regarding water waste and water quality.

The main goal for the city of Jerusalem is to promote water conservation behaviours, achieve quantifiable water savings and improved awareness regarding water quality by sharing data with other water utilities. The objective is to encourage a rational use of water, and encourage the implementation of NRW reduction and water quality monitoring technologies and methodologies.

The POWER DSP will provide a specific dashboard for city administrations/water utility management/other utilities/users providing insights into the processes of collective awareness-raising within the city aiming to identify specific segments to provide more appropriate and targeted incentives.

These four pilot cities will be supported by other cities from EIP Water – City Blueprints and NetwercH2O, to create a larger network addressing each of the four areas. All cities will provide a City Blueprint to highlight water related issues in their area and to compare their “blueprint” with that of other cities.
